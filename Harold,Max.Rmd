1, Do female shopped more than male on Black Friday Sales?

2, I am trying to find a job that is related to data analytics after graduating in 6 month. Five years after my graduation, I want to go to grad school without my parents financially supporting me, hopefully, five years can earn me enough fmoney for doing that.

3,I am hoping to acquire decent knowledge of R in data analysis, meanwhile having a great experience working in a group and accomplish some projects together as a whole. For me, the greatest accomplishment of my career would be earning tons of money, the more money the better it is.

4, I am a junior in Information Science, with a minor in business analytics track. Information science was a brand new program under CMCI; therefore, many classes that I have taken are very similar to STATS, but are technically not considered as STATS. So hopefully, I am not super behind to those who have legit mathmatic backgroud.
