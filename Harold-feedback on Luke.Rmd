##Lucas Brack
*Which is easier to get from in the NFL, being a mediocre team for a long time(1o years or so) or being a really bad team for a shorter time(2-4 years)?
*6 months after I graduate I want to have a job that I'm using my degree for. 5 years after I graduate I want have found a promising career.
*The greatest career accomplishment that I want to acheive is making 7 figures a year.
*The thing I hope to accomplish in this class is learning R so I can apply it to future jobs.
*I am a big NASCAR fan.

# Harold
*I not 100% sure what were you trying to say when saying"easier to get from in the NFL", like get what?
*We seem to have a very similar goal after graduating.
*Likewise dude, money means so much to us
*Haha.

# Max 
*Your question is funny and a good question. Your and my goals are pretty much the same. You're the first NASCAR fan I know.
