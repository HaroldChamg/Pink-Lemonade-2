## Feedback from Jon:
* Very nice picture, it really lets us see the real you.  I like the clean format you used.  Make sure to be more specific on what you want to be doing in a few years, unless you don't exactly know.  If that's the case, maybe say so.  Very nice introduction.


##Feedback from Lucas:
* Your code is formatted really well, it makes it easy to read. You could add more details into what you want to learn in the class.

Feedback from Harold:
* I'd say provided more information of you so we get to know you more somehow. I am color blind too, Red, Green, Blue and Purple.
