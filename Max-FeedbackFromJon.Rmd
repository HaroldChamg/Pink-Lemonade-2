# About me - Max Ward
## Pic of me
![](Max.jpg)

* How do cats jump so high? 

* Working and then still working at a cool job

* Making millions of dollars

* Anything that can make that happen

* I am color blind

## Feedback from Jon:
* Very nice picture, it really lets us see the real you.  I like the clean format you used.  Make sure to be more specific on what you want to be doing in a few years, unless you don't exactly know.  If that's the case, maybe say so.  Very nice introduction.
